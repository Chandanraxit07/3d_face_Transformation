Summary: MediaPipe 3D Face Transform Project

Overview

The MediaPipe 3D Face Transform project involves using the MediaPipe framework to detect and transform 3D facial landmarks in real-time. MediaPipe, developed by Google, is a versatile library for building cross-platform machine learning pipelines, particularly in computer vision. This project focuses on leveraging MediaPipe's face mesh solution to capture detailed facial landmarks and apply transformations such as rotations, translations, and scaling in 3D space.

Key Features of MediaPipe Face Mesh

High Precision: Detects 468 3D facial landmarks.

Real-time Performance: Optimized for low latency, suitable for real-time applications.

Cross-Platform: Works on mobile, desktop, and web platforms.

Easy Integration: Can be combined with other libraries like OpenCV for additional image processing tasks.
